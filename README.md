# Password Generator Refactor Project

## Description:

### This webpage is a basic, JavaScript-based random password generator, that can be used to create a password that includes any combination of criteria, and of a desired length between 8 and 128 characters.
--------------------------------------------------------------
## Assignment

### Our assignment was to take the current non-functional password generation page and re-factor it so that it works. The page did not originally have a function for password generation. The password generator function had to be created and tested. The page did include the querySelector for the #generate id, as well as the eventListener for click functionality.

## Learning 

### Learning more about prompt(), confirm(), and alert() methods was paramount. I learned the distinction in their purposes, and had to decide the best fit for the context. Prompt() required input and room for user error, so I thought it best to limit its use. I chose confirm() for the majority of criteria prompts, then ended up using all three methods in my code. I also *really* wanted the user to be able to end the process by clicking away from these pop-ups. Ultimately, I could not find a way to do this in the assignment's time frame, but I wish to incorporate this functionality in the future.

### As with all past assignments, I spent an obscene amount of time debugging a very simple syntax issue. Also, when I thought I had the website completed and functional, I realized that if I ran the generator more than a few times, it would occasionally not include only one of the criteria. I consulted with AskBCS Learning Assistants, but the person I connected with said they couldn't duplicate my problem, and they closed the ticket. I was disappointed in this interaction.

### Out of curiosity, I looked at a friend's deployed application of this same assignment, and his also has this exact issue.
